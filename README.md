ObjectBox Embedded Database for C and C++
=========================================
[ObjectBox](https://objectbox.io) is a lightweight yet powerful on-device database for objects and vectors.
The out-of-the-box [Data Sync](https://objectbox.io/sync/) keeps data in sync across devices and any kind of backend/cloud reliably for occasionally connected devices.
ObjectBox Data Persistence and Data Sync follows an offline-first approach and can be used on-premise as well as with a cloud setup.

*********************************************************************************************************************************
Jobs: We're looking for a [C++ Developer](https://objectbox.io/jobs/objectbox-senior-c-plusplus-developer/) with a ‚ù§Ô∏è for performant code
*********************************************************************************************************************************

This is the **ObjectBox runtime library** to run ObjectBox as an embedded database in your C or C++ application.

Here's a C++ example that inserts a `Task` data object (a plain user defined `struct`) into the database:
```c++
obx::Box<Task> box(store);
box.put({.text = "Buy milk"}); 
```

See [ObjectBox C and C++ docs](https://cpp.objectbox.io/) for API details.

**Latest version: 4.3.0** (2025-05-12).
See [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more details.

Feature Highlights
------------------
üß† **First on-device vector database:** easily manage vector data and perform fast vector search\
üèÅ **High performance** on restricted devices, like IoT gateways, micro controllers, ECUs etc.\
ü™Ç **Resourceful** with minimal CPU, power and Memory usage for maximum flexibility and sustainability\
üîó **Relations:** object links / relationships are built-in\
üíª **Multiplatform:** Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, macOS

üå± **Scalable:** handling millions of objects resource-efficiently with ease\
üíê **Queries:** filter data as needed, even across relations\
ü¶Æ **Statically typed:** compile time checks & optimizations\
üìÉ **Automatic schema migrations:** no update scripts needed

**And much more than just data persistence**\
üë• **[ObjectBox Sync](https://objectbox.io/sync/):** keeps data in sync between devices and servers\
üïí **[ObjectBox TS](https://objectbox.io/time-series-database/):** time series extension for time based data

Some more technical details:

* Zero-copy reads for highest possible performance; access tens of millions of objects on commodity hardware
* Lightweight for smart devices; its binary size is only around 1 MB
* Direct support for [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) data objects (aka "flatbuffers table")
* Flex type to represent any FlexBuffers
* Secondary indexes based on object properties
* Async API for asynchronous puts, inserts, updates, removes
* Optimized for time series data (TS edition only)
* Data synchronization across the network (sync edition only)

Usage and Installation
----------------------
In most cases you want to use the C and C++ APIs in combination with the **[ObjectBox Generator](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-generator) tool**.
This way, you get a convenient C or C++ API which requires minimal code on your side to work with the database.

The APIs come as single header file for C and C++:

* C: [include/objectbox.h](include/objectbox.h)
* C++: [include/objectbox.hpp](include/objectbox.hpp) (depends on objectbox.h)

Compile your code against it and use the binary library (.so, .dylib, .dll depending on the platform) to link against.
Head over to [ObjectBox C and C++ installation docs](https://cpp.objectbox.io/installation) for step-by-step instructions.

C++ API
-------
The C++ API is built on top of the C API exposed by the library (e.g. you still need objectbox.h).
You can also use both APIs from your code if necessary.
For example, you use the C++ `obx::Box` class for most database operations, but "break out" into the C API for a special function you need.  
Note that to use the `obx::Box` class, you also need the [ObjectBox Generator](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-generator) to generate binding code.
Find more details how to use it the [Getting started](https://cpp.objectbox.io/getting-started) section of the docs.

Examples
--------
Have a look at the following TaskList example apps, depending on your programming language and preference:

* [C, cursor, no generated code](examples/c-cursor-no-gen) - plain C; using flatcc directly; without any generated code
* [C, with generated code](examples/c-gen) - plain C, using code generated by `objectbox-generator`
* [C++, with generated code](examples/cpp-gen) - C++, using code generated by `objectbox-generator`
  * also includes sync client application example

Documentation
-------------
* [C and C++ docs](https://cpp.objectbox.io/) - official ObjectBox C and C++ documentation
* [include/objectbox.h](include/objectbox.h) - C API header file contains docs as code comments
* [include/objectbox.hpp](include/objectbox.hpp) - C++ API header file contains docs as code comments
* [C and C++ API reference docs](https://objectbox.io/docfiles/c/current/) - online HTML docs (Doxygen)

Changelog/Updating
------------------
Please refer to the **[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)** for the latest updates and changes.
We are (mostly) following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

If you update from a previous version, please also check the changelog.

Supported platforms
-------------------
* Linux 64-bit
* Linux ARMv6hf (e.g. Raspberry PI Zero)
* Linux ARMv7hf (e.g. Raspberry PI 3/4)
* Linux ARMv8/AArch64 (e.g. Raspberry PI 3/4 with a 64-bit OS like Ubuntu)
* macOS 64-bit
* Windows 32-bit
* Windows 64-bit

Note that e.g. our Android SDK (part of [another repo](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java))
also exposes the C API, so you can use ObjectBox in your Android NDK projects.

C API as the Foundation for Higher Languages
--------------------------------------------
The plain C API (without the Generator) also serves as a basis for ObjectBox bindings in higher languages.
For example, the official APIs for [Go](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go), [Swift](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift), [Dart/Flutter](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart) and [Python](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-python) rely on the C API.
In the same way, you could create an ObjectBox API for another programming language, e.g. for JavaScript.
For the C API, data consists of bytes representing FlatBuffers tables, which you can build and read in your language of choice.

Other languages/bindings
------------------------
ObjectBox supports multiple platforms and languages.
Besides C/C++, ObjectBox also offers:

* [ObjectBox Java / Kotlin](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java): runs on Android, desktop, and servers.
* [ObjectBox Swift](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-swift): build fast mobile apps for iOS (and macOS)
* [ObjectBox Dart/Flutter](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart): cross-platform for mobile and desktop apps
* [ObjectBox Go](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-go): great for data-driven tools and embedded server applications
