ObjectBox C and C++ API Changelog
=================================

5.0.0-rc (2025-09-30)
------------------

### User-Specific Data Sync

* Sync filters: define server-side filter expression to sync individual data for each sync user.
  This is also known as "user-specific data sync" and requires Sync clients version 5.0.
* Client variables: clients may define key/value pairs that can be used in sync filters

### Fixes

* Fixed clearing 1:N backlinks for IDs larger than 32-bit (setting backlink ID to 0 on the "1" side)
* In-memory with WAL file: improved error handling
* Safeguard against undefined behavior by panicking in rare illegal usage patterns that are not recoverable.
  I.e. deleting a (write) transaction in a non-owner thread cannot be safely handled in any other way.

### Examples

* Make each example self-contained, you can e.g. copy an example's directory as a starting point for your own app
* Add a convenient `build.sh` script to each example that works the same way across examples,
  e.g. `./build.sh run` to build and run the example in one step
* Make sources more readable (refactorings, added additional comments)

4.3.1 (2025-07-28)
------------------
* Cursor/Query: deleting a cursor (e.g. in a non-creator thread) waits for any query to finish 
* Query: added safety check to detect using a deleted query instance
* Admin: fix displaying some string values twice
* Add a few missing allocation failure checks 
* Internal improvements, e.g. updated dependencies and compiler to new major versions

4.3.0 (2025-05-12)
------------------
* Windows: msvc runtime is now embedded to avoid incompatible msvcp140.dll (e.g. those shipped with some JDKs)
* External property types (via MongoDB connector): JsonToNative to support sub (embedded/nested) documents/arrays in MongoDB 
* External property types (via MongoDB connector): support ID mapping to UUIDs (v4 and v7)
* Admin: add class and dependency diagrams to the schema page (view and download)
* Admin: improved data view for large vectors by displaying only the first elements and the full vector in a dialog
* Admin: detects images stored as bytes and shows them as such (PNG, GIF, JPEG, SVG, WEBP)

### Sync

* Add "Log Events" for important server events, which can be viewed on new Admin page
* Detect and ignore changes for objects that were put but were unchanged
* The limit for message size was raised to 32 MB
* Transactions above the message size limit will already fail on the client now (to better enforce the limit)
* C++: add missing APIs for JWT token credentials

4.2.0 (2025-03-04)
------------------
* Extended the model by external names and types:
  allows defining a different name for an external database, which ObjectBox syncs with.

This prepares upcoming features for our [MongoDB Sync Connector](https://sync.objectbox.io/mongodb-sync-connector). 

4.1.0 (2025-01-28)
------------------
* New query conditions for map properties (via flex properties):
  now supports key/value pairs for inequality conditions (e.g. greater than, less than) for string,
  integer and floating point values
* Vector search: add "Geo" distance type for longitude/latitude pairs
* Various internal improvements

### Sync

* Add JWT authentication
* Sync clients can now send multiple credentials for login

4.0.3 (2024-11-11)
------------------
* CMake Integration with ObjectBox Generator 4.0.0 

4.0.2 (2024-10-15)
------------------
* Made closing the store more robust; e.g. it waits for ongoing queries and transactions to finish
  (please still ensure to clean up properly on your side, this is an additional safety net)
* Made Box API more robust when racing against store closing
* Improved C++ APIs for nearest neighbor search (query building etc.)
* Some minor HNSW performance improvements
* Add "vectorsearch-cities" example

### Sync

* Fixed a serious regression; please update to the latest version asap!
* Added a special compression for tiny transactions
* Embedded clusters (note: the cluster feature may not come with all editions of the library)
* Add FlatBuffers based configuration for Sync Server

4.0.1 (2024-07-17)
------------------
* Query: "visit with score" added, so you can consume vector search results one-by-one with a visitor callback 

4.0.0 (2024-05-15)
------------------
* ObjectBox now supports vector search ("vector database") to enable efficient similarity searches.
  This is particularly useful for AI/ML/RAG applications, e.g. image, audio, or text similarity.
  Other use cases include semantic search or recommendation engines.
  See https://docs.objectbox.io/ann-vector-search for details.
* Adjusting the version number to match the core version (4.0); we will be aligning on major versions from now on.

0.21.0 (2024-02-13)
-------------------
* In-memory databases (prefix the directory option with "memory:")

### Sync

* Use "ObjectBox Admin" users as Sync users (permission-based)

-------------------
* Added OBXFeature_Backup to query for the feature's availability
* Internal: added a DB store abstraction layer (another announcement about this will follow)
* Tree API: fix for meta IDs vs. IDs

* Minor API clean up: e.g. using int types for bit flags not enums
* Fixes query link condition in combination with some "or" conditions
* Fixes query "less" condition for case-sensitive strings with value indexes (default is hashed index)
* Updated Linux toolchain; now requires glibc 2.28 or higher (and GLIBCXX_3.4.25);
  e.g. the following minium versions are fine: Debian Buster 10 (2019), Ubuntu 20.04, RHEL 8 (2019)

* Several internal improvements, e.g. query links are resolved faster 

0.8.2 (2020-01-13)
------------------
* Fix ARM build incorrectly returning TRUE in obx_supports_bytes_array()
  
0.8.1 (2019-12-12)
------------------
* Bug fix for obx_box_rel_get_ids(), which did return wrong IDs in some cases (please update!)
* Several refinements on property queries, for example:

### (Breaking) Changes

* **obx_txn_success(txn) now also closes the transaction making a subsequent obx_txn_close(txn) unnecessary and illegal.**
  Please adjust your code using one of two possibilities (depending on your code flow):
   * drop `obx_txn_close(txn)` after calling `obx_txn_success(txn)`, or
   * replace `obx_txn_success(txn)` with `obx_txn_mark_success(txn, true)` if you want to keep `obx_txn_close(txn)`
* Function renames to drop "create" postfix:
  obx_query_builder(), obx_query(), obx_cursor(), obx_model(), obx_bytes_array(), obx_id_array()
* Property queries API clean up using a OBX_query_prop struct 

0.6.0 (2019-07-15)

* Added property queries with results referring to single property (not complete objects).
  Note: APIs will change with next release.
* Several smaller improvements; e.g.
  obx_query_* functions don't require a cursor anymore, added obx_store_await_async_submitted(), ...

### (Breaking) Changes

* The OBX_store_options struct is now private
  * Build OBX_store_options using obx_opt()

* `cursor_seek()` to point to the the element with given id (and also check if that element exists)
* `corsor_current()` to get the data of the current element (similar to `cursor_first()`, `next()`)
* `query_visit()` to traverse over the query results and call the provided callback on each item
         
Changes:

* prefix defined constants (enums) with OBX
* `model_*` functions now always return the first error (as it may be the cause of other follow-up errors as well)
* `box_put_async()` now takes timeout in milliseconds (previously it was a fixed number)

* renamed `query_describe_parameters()` to `query_describe_params()`
* renamed `query_to_string()` to `query_describe()`
